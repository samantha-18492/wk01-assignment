# wk01-assignment

Requirements achieved:

- header, nav and footer
- CSS absolute positioning
- CSS flexbox
- image elements added as background decorative images instead of using the img tag (as recommended)
- hover effect on buttons
- background music that plays automatically and hidden (sorry!)

Reflections:

- more experience needed to gain confidence with using flexbox. w3schools and mdn website both really helpful. action: to review css-tricks website
- more revision needed to gain confidence with using positioning and z-index values
- adjusting settings via the elements dev tool proved to be invaluable
